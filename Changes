- The clone_without_attachments() method would die when calling on an email
  that contained both plain and html inline parts.


0.04     2011-06-04

- Add missing prereq on File::LibMagic (needed since 0.02).


0.03     2011-06-04

- The encoding parameter is now always set in a part's headers.


0.02     2011-06-04

- Added all_parts_matching() method to Courriel class.

- Added clone_without_attachments() method to Courriel class.

- The Courriel::Part::Single attribute raw_content has been renamed as
  encoded_content.

- The text_body_part() method is now called plain_body_part().

- The add() and unshift() methods in Courriel::Headers now accept only one
  value.

- Added Courriel::Headers->replace as a convenience method.

- A header with attributes (like Content-Type) can escape values inside a
  quoted string, like value="foo \" bar". Courriel wasn't unescaping these
  values.

- It is now possible to pass a Courriel::Disposition object explicitly when
  constructing a Courriel::Part::Single object. The docs said this was
  possible in 0.01, but the parameter was just ignored.

- If a part is created with an explicit content_type and/or disposition
  object, the part's headers will be updated so that the Content-Type and
  Content-Disposition match the given object.

- The boundary for a Multipart part and the boundary in its ContentType's
  attributes will always be the same.

- All classes now use MooseX::StrictConstructor.

- Some hacks to make it possible for Courriel to play nice with
  Email::Abstract.

- Fixed some small doc errors.


0.01     2011-05-31
